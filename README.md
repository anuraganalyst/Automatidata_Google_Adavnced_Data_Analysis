# Problem Statement
To Develop a Regression Model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on the data gathered by New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

# Tool used
Python

# Datasets
[2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data](https://github.com/anuraganalyst/Automatidata_Google_Adavnced_Data_Analysis/blob/main/2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data%20(1).csv  )

# Insights
The model reveals that for every mile travelled the fare increases by $2. Or for every 3.57 miles travelled, the fare increases by $7.13.

The model provides a generally strong and reliable fare prediction that can be used in downstream modeling efforts.

These findings can be used to create an app that allows NYC TLC riders to see the estimated fare before their ride begins. Model Metrics: Model metrics:

R-squared 0.868: This means that 86.8% of the variance is described by the model.

MAE 2.13

MSE: 14.34

RMSE 3.8
